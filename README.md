## Overview
Bracket Buddy is an Android application designed to help tournament organizers manage and run their tournaments locally 
through their mobile devices. It interacts with the start.gg API for fetching and modifying the user's start.gg data. 
Bracket Buddy provides a user-friendly alternative to the "notoriously poor" start.gg website functionality on mobile 
devices. With Bracket Buddy, tournament organizers can save time and reduce frustration, making it an invaluable tool for 
managing tournaments on the go. 

## Features
- **Log in**: The tournament organizer (TO) can log into their start.gg account through our app.
- **Access tournaments and events**: The TO can access their current and upcoming tournaments and events.
- **Access and modify bracket matches**: The TO can see the bracket matches for a given event, declare the result 
of the match, and upload the changes to start.gg. 
- **Modify seeding**: The TO can modify the seeding for a bracket and upload the changes to start.gg. 
- **Call sets**: The TO can assign players to specific setups or stations.
- **Ensure controller compatibility**: The TO can keep track of players with limiting controllers while calling sets 
to ensure that players can only be called to setups where their controllers are compatible.
- **Track payments**: The TO can keep track of which attendees have paid, in order to calculate total revenue of the 
tournament and collect payment from unpaid entrants.
- **Generate Event Description**: The TO can generate a description for an event, which can be used for advertising 
the event.

   Go to the Start.gg dashboard at [Start.gg](https://www.start.gg/). Press the login button on the bottom left and
   then click "Create a new account". Then set your username and password
2. **Enable installation of unknown apps**: 
Go to Settings > Apps > Special app access > Install unknown apps. You can also enable Unknown sources in Settings > Security. 
3. **Download the APK file**: 
Download the BracketBuddy.apk file on this github repository.
You can download the APK file to your computer and then transfer it to your Android device in the download folder.
You can also download APK files from the github on mobile using software like APK pure. 
4. **Open the APK file**: 
Open the APK file using the app you granted permission to install it from. You can also use your Android device's file manager
to locate the APK file. 
5. **Install the app**:

6. **Log in on the app**: 
   Once you open the app, you will be prompted to login to Start.gg. Log in using the information you created in step 1.
   Now, the app should redirect you to the select tournament menu where you can see any tournaments that you manage.

#### Common Issues:
The app does not appear in my app drawer on my phone - Make sure the apk is placed in the download folder and that your
permissions are configured as shown in step 2.

The tournament selection page is empty - If you don't have any tournaments created on the Start.gg website, then nothing
should appear here. To progress past this menu create a tournament on Start.gg. If you need help doing this, you can watch a tutorial [here](https://help.start.gg/en/articles/1465683-creating-a-tournament).

Log in page shows a connection error - This occurs if the phone has limited or inconsistent access to the internet.
Try reconnecting your Wi-fi and rerunning the app.

   then click "Create a new account". Then set your username and password

4. **Download the main branch from GitHub and open it in IntelliJ or Android Studio**:

5. **Download the following gradle libraries:**:
   org.nanohttpd:nanohttpd, Version 2.3.1

#### Common Issues:
The app crashes on start-up with an API permission error on LogCat - Make sure the local.properties folder is created
and populated exactly as shown in step 6.

Gradle build failed on IntelliJ or Android Studio - Redownload the files from GitHub and ensure that the project
files are configured properly.

Gradle build is successful but no app is generated - After running the Gradle build once, switch to the Android app
configuration which should already be generated by Gradle. Running this configuration should build the app.

The tournament selection page is empty - If you don't have any tournaments created on the Start.gg website, then nothing
should appear here. To progress past this menu create a tournament on Start.gg. If you need help doing this, you can watch a tutorial [here](https://help.start.gg/en/articles/1465683-creating-a-tournament).

The login page shows a connection error - This occurs if the phone has limited or inconsistent access to the internet.
Try reconnecting your Wi-fi and rerunning the app.
